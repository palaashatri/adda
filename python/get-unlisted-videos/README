Unlisted YouTube Videos Scraper

This script is designed to scrape unlisted YouTube videos and store their metadata in a CSV file.

Features:
* Retrieves unlisted YouTube videos
* Stores video metadata (title, link, author, upload date, view count) in a CSV file
* Paginates indefinitely to fetch all available results

Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* `pytube` and `youtube-dl` libraries installed (`pip install pytube youtube-dl`)
* YouTube API key (optional but recommended)

Usage:
1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual YouTube API key, if you have one.
2. Run the script using Python: `python unlisted_videos_scraper.py`
3. The script will generate a CSV file named `unlisted_videos.csv` in the same directory as the script.

Limitations:
* This script is designed to fetch unlisted videos only and may not work with other types of content (e.g., playlists, live streams).
* YouTube's API has limits on the number of requests and data returned, so be mindful of these restrictions when working with large datasets.
* The script may take some time to complete depending on the number of results and your internet connection.
